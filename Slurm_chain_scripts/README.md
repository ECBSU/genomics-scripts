# Chain scripts for slurm
These are a collection of bash scripts submitting chain jobs to Deigo. Their main advantage is consistency and ease of use, allowing for multiple analyses to be performed in series. 

To run any of the scripts copy them over to your Deigo home folder (or any other folder writeable from the compute partition). Write your input into the appropriate lines of the wrapper script, and then execute the wrapper script.
