# Bin identification pipeline
## Info
This pipeline identifies .fasta files by annotating with prokka, extracting the 16S sequences from the prokka annotation,
and BLASTing the 16S genes against the ncbi nt database.

It also runs BLASTn and MEGAN on each fasta, and creates a summary of the MEGAN output (so the megan application doesnt
have to be opened, and the .rma doesn't have to be imported)

## Input
This pipeline is designed to work on the output generated by the DASTool-based binning pipeline. For general fasta's check the 
bin_identification_pipeline_general_fasta directory
