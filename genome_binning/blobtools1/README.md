Running blobtools, this is for blobtools1. Take note that using the different database requires some formatting changes, these should already be part of the code block in the respective scripts
It is also possible to have the 3 database results all compiled together and used to create the blobplot. please see the manual https://blobtools.readme.io/docs for more details
